# Odd-Eve-Game-Task

I have created the smart contract named oddEvenGame. First I have declared three state variables named score, isEnded and randNonce.
  1. Score --> uint256 --> This will store computer's scores.
  2. isEnded --> bool --> This is a flag for the match is ended or not.
  3. randNonce --> uint256 --> This will store a random nonce which will help to generate random values.
  
Then I declared and defined some fuctions like -->

  1. randomNo --> This is a function which is used to generate random number.
  2. reset --> This is a function which will reset the value of score to zero and turn the flag isEnded to false to restarts the match. 
  Basically this function restarts the match.
  3. play -->  This function will take a user value ranging from 1 to 6 and checks if the user value is equal to the random generated value 
  or not and and then does the logic part respectively.
              
              
First I tested my contract on remix virtual machine then I have deployed the contract to goerli testnet.
        Goerli testnet address --> 0xCD4288fD856BDbd2ea7dA112936a2f8419435631
        
        
 Tests --> 
  1. Played the match by putting user input 2.

  In this the decode input is number 2 and output is "5 RUNS"
        
  2. Again played the match by putting user input 2.

  In this the decode input is number 2 and output is "1 RUNS"
        
  3. Played the match once again by putting the user input 2.

  In this the decode input is number 2 and output is "18 OUT"
        
  4. After the computer got out then I played without hitting the reset button so I got this error that match has ended.. press reset to restart
